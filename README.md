# geographic
This repository compiles scripts I have written to faciliate the processing and analysis of data broken down by geographic location (state, county, etc.).

The states.sh script is intended to be run from the command line in bash, and its function is to convert the two-letter abbreviations for each US state (as well as the District of Columbia) into the state/district's full name. It should be run by entering "./states.sh filename", where you want to replace all the two-letter US state abbreviations in the file "filename" with their full names, and where said file is in the current directory.
